These are just some of my notes.  DO NOT read them.  They won't make any sence to you.

Neural coding:

Imagine you are sampling a signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).  For example, intensity of a pixel in a Black and White camera at 60fps.  At the time of the first video frame t=0ms the pixel value is 50.  At time of the next frame t=16.6ms the pixel value is 53 and so on as shown in the table below.  Instead of delivering a stream of changes every time a photon strikes the sensor, the hardware is "optimized" to summ up the changes and deliver them as numbers.

time(ms)   value
0          50      
16.6       53
33.3       51
49.9       51
66.6       50

Using linear extrapolation, we can rearrange this information as shown in the following table.  Non-linear extrapolation can be used in a more realistic model by utilizing rates of change calculated in prevous steps.

time(ms)   value   rate of change (ms)
0          50      
5.5        51      5.5  positive
11.1       52      5.5  positive
16.6       53      5.5  positive
24.9       52      8.3  negative
33.3       51      16.6 negative
66.6       50      33.3 negative  (notice sample listed in a previous table at time 49.9 is missing)

At this point, the sequence of pixel values can be expressed as the initial value (50) and a sequence of "rate of change": 5.5+, 11.1+, 16.6+, 24.9-, 33.3-, 66.6-
Assume that the initial value is not important.  For simplicity's sake, when you turn on the system it's always zero.

What I am proposing is decoupling information from sampling rate of the device (framerate of the camera etc...)  One of the reasons to do that is because pixels in each frame are NOT even "captured" at the same time by CMOS cameras:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_shutter
When you change the camera in your system, it might have a different frame rate.
Most importantly, information in this format can be fed as exitatory and inhibitory neural spikes directly into an artificial spiking neural network.


############### Should any of this info be included in the paper?  (As an appendix?) #######################
Compare apples to oranges:
How about a "purple over here" and a "green over there"?  What units can we measure them with? Why do we separate the measures into different domains of color and space?  What if the observer is color blind?  For him, color is a completely foreign domain.  We have to have a domain-independent representation.  This need relates to concepts of symbol grounding and qualia.  The domain-independent representation can be accomplished by representing everything in terms of time.

Detection is a way of thinking about the mechanism of perception.  One of its forms is threshold detection.
Why consider detection mechanism? Assuming this model, creates a framework for an exhaustive search for rules of state modification. 
Algorithm of changing state changes itself over time. Synapses change over time.  Habituation gives us a hint that the detection algorithm can also change over time. How does the environment influence the change mechanism?   Why is there an inhibiting mechanism?

The assumption that state can describe perception is a result of the state-oriented view of the world as opposed to process-oriented. In the process-oriented view, a change in a process can be described by when it occurred as opposed to how the state changed.

A thermostat can detect a change in temperature.  It can make my AC actuate.  Does it perceive the change?

As a function terminates, twitch the muscle.  How does this relate to lambda calculus?

Manchester encoding adds observer clock synchronization to symbols used to communicate.

Machine learning deals with data bypassing perception

One cannot detect what he or she does not know. only changes can be detected
Medium is required to deliver a message.  The fact that new information is received is in itself a change.

The brightness of a pixel (red 34) VS one pixel is brighter than the other.  Which carries more information?

What action should I perform right now? And should I perform a specific action right now?  Both approaches use all available up to now information.

It's easier to control a process if a control system is able to take into account or influence derivatives as it occurs in a PID controller.

perception is different from cognition!!!

Mechanism of perception separates life from things which are not alive.  Life has a process within while things are changed by the processes they are a part of.  One exception is radioactive decay.

This gives rise to a misconception where an observer perceives the environment and magically changes it's own internal state accordingly.  In the reality, the environment changes an observer's internal state.  Assume any system we build is modular.  Let's look at each module as an observer.
Just because they are inside the system, the mechanisms of information sharing among them are not any different.  Describe perception vs sensory perception: mechanism of perception is prevalent in the Central nervous system as well as in the peripheral nervous system.

Embodiment also provides a scale for the system. Without a scale your AI could decide that the only interesting thing worth while is nanotechnology and you can change the whole world one atom at a time.

Neuron firing is a process that could be measured as a whole by an interval of time however it has to be separated into two mechanism: "firing and state change process that includes propagation of potential through an axon and synapses.  Neuron firing is defined by a point in time and not intervals in time.  Before neuron fires and after.

For example, modeling artificial neural network (ANN) synapses as oscillators or processes instead of weights.
If a human is out of the loop, it's usually the case where certain output symbols are assigned actions by system designers.

As I state perception is related to qualia as I believe qualia is a perception of a form.  All that's left in order to understand how form is represented in the brain is to show how the brain stores information .  Not an easy task indeed.

is perception like a DTFT from frequency domain into time domain?  Percepts (frequencies) are transformed into a time domain???

As a thought experiment I used to imagine that it's possible to represent processes occurring in the brain as a pinball machine with millions or billions of balls flying around and interacting. Hence I think that it's not important to have a framework for modeling but to find the basic transformations the information undergoes during these processes. And the first question therefore , how is information going to be represented?

Relative frequency of occurrence of an event is a measure of the probability in the frequentist interpretation.
find random variables hidden in a signal automatically ( reducing the dimensionality of the data? )
Random variable realization is not necessarily an experiment outcome.
Detection of changes in the environment defines all possible outcomes of an experiment.
If it cannot be detected, it cannot become an outcome in the experiment.
Perceiving any continuous random process will yield discrete time observations - discrete mappings to a set of outcomes.
Each observer detects an outcome in an experiment.  The set of outcomes is defined for a short time period within the window of an experiment.
Detection described in terms of point processes form a set of possible outcomes.
Perception converts a continuous random process into a point process.
Perception is a method of selection.  A method of observation of a random process.  It results in a point process.


<NOTE1>
Life can be defined by the ability to detect the interinal state change and the presence of an internal process. There are exceptions: Radioactive decay where there is an internal process.  Freezing and thawing of plants and animals which continue to live.  In this case the environment stops and starts the internal process.

Outside world changes you and you "perceive" this "change within you". This is how perception works.  Green leafs are NOT green themselves! They do not emit green light. They reflect it. However emitted and reflected green light modify your retina the same way.


###########################
Current approaches (except spiking ANNs) suffer from time being a hyperparameter. Time needs to be an implicit part of the system.  We can not feed snapshots of the world into the system and expect interesting behavior in return.
